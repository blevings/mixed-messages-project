# Mixed Messages Codecademy Portfolio Project

## Introduction

The objective of the Codecademy Mixed Messages project is to generate a script that will output a message that includes at least three randomly selected pieces of information.

For my project, I decided to generate three random verses: one from the Old Testament (excluding Psalms), one from Psalms, and one from the New Testament.
